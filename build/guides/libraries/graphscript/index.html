<p><code>graphscript</code> is the foundational library behind the logic of <code>brainsatplay</code>.</p>
<p>This library allows you to design very complicated systems with very few lines of code.</p>
<!-- 1. You can use a [Graph](./graphs) to sequence behaviors.
2. You can use a [Socket](./sockets) to expose behaviors to networked environments.
3. You can use a [Router](./routers) to process varied commands from the network. -->
<p>You can find more information about this library <a href="https://github.com/brainsatplay/graphscript">here</a>.</p><hr />
