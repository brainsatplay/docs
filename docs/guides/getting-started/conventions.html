<p>As defined by <a href="https://github.com/brainsatplay/es-plugins">es-plugins</a> <strong>plugin</strong> is an ESM file that contains one default export and named exports that are used to provide additional metadata about the usage of the former.</p>
<p>:::info</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Any default export should be a function</strong>—ideally stateless.</li>
<li><strong>Named exports should be modifiers</strong> for this function, consistent with the <a href="../libraries/es-plugins/index.md">ES Plugins</a> and <a href="../libraries/wasl/index.html">WASL</a>standards.

<p><code>``javascript title="hello.js"
export default (message="world") =&gt; console.log(</code>hello ${message}!`)</p>
<pre><code>## Components
A **component** is an extension of the **plugin** type which specifies a logic flow between **plugin** instances in a `[name].wasl.json` file. Accompanied by a `package.json` file, **components** may use the `main` field to specify an exposed library—composed of **plugins**—for distribution on Node Package Manager (NPM).

:::note 
This is what is visualized by the Files tab of the `brainsatplay-editor`.
:::

To be editable by `brainsatplay.editable` classes, you must have your source code accessible from Github, NPM, or other locations.

### Native vs. Mashup
**Native components** contain all of their logic internally.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
// self-contained logic
export default (message="world") =&gt; console.log(<code>hello ${message}!</code>)</p>
<pre><code>**Mashup components** adapt existing NPM libraries by wrapping their essential classes and function calls.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
// external library usage
import * as graphscript from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/graphscript/dist/index.esm.js'
const graph = new graphscript.Graph({
    operator: (message="world") =&gt; console.log(<code>hello ${message}!</code>)
})</p>
<p>// encapsulated library object
export default () =&gt; graph.run('world')</p>
<pre><code>## Graphs
A **graph** is a connected set of **plugins** that pass messages between each other. 

As specified in `.wasl.json` files, each **graph** has **nodes** and **edges**. You may think of **nodes** as the plugin instances in the graph, whereas **edges** are the flow logic that happens *between* these plugins.
</code></pre>
<p>json title="index.wasl.json"
{
    "graph": {
        "nodes": {
            "input": {
                "src": "input.js"
            },
            "output": {
                "src": "output.js"
            },
        },
        "edges": {
            "input": {
                "output": {},
            }
        }
    }
}
```</p>
<p>:::note 
Nodes in the <strong>graph</strong> are individually visualized by the Properties tab (TBD) of the <code>@brainsatplay/studio</code>, while edges are visualized by the Graph tab.
:::</p>
<p>:::info 
Although specified in the WASL standard, these are <em>not</em> handled by the <a href="../libraries/wasl/index.md">wasl</a> library itself. Instead, <strong>graphs</strong> are assembled by external libraries such as <a href="../libraries/graphscript/index.html">graphscript</a>.
