<p>Denizens of the Internet,</p>
<p>For too long, you have been considered passive consumers of the World Wide Web. Since the development of the first web browser-editor (<a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb / Nexus</a>) in 1990, the web has transitioned into a passive, constrained medium for transaction.</p>
<p>Join us to reinvigorate its original mission: To make the internet accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>We are hosting a community application at https://brainsatplay.com. This was designed on top of the Web Application Specification Language (WASL) to allow for the entire web to be architected as an indexable set of composable units.</p>
<p>Explore it. Copy it. Remix it. Plagiarize it. Show us what you can do. </p>
