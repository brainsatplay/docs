<h2 id="httpfrontend">HTTPfrontend</h2>
<p>The HTTPfrontend service mainly provides some macros for xhr requests. </p>
<p>Using .listen(), this frontend also can proxy the window's built in fetch function so you can intercept http responses which can act.</p>
<pre><code class="ts language-ts">import {HTTPfrontend} from 'graphscript'

const http = new HTTPfrontend();

http.listen()

//now check the console! 
</code></pre>
<p>You can listen to specific paths independently and customize the fetch responses using cloned responses (so normal page flow is not disturbed).</p>
