<h2 id="workers">Workers</h2>
<p>To use workers within our graph hierarchy, we need to establish a worker service in the worker. This will set up the onmessage function correctly to interpret service messages.</p>
<p>e.g. worker.ts</p>
<pre><code class="ts language-ts">//functionality
import { WorkerService, workerCanvasRoutes, workerCanvasRoutes, unsafeRoutes, ECSService } from 'graphscript';

//wonder if we can have a scheme to dynamic import within the services? e.g. to bring in node-only or browser-only services without additional workers

declare var WorkerGlobalScope;

if(typeof WorkerGlobalScope !== 'undefined' &amp;&amp; self instanceof WorkerGlobalScope) {
    (self as any).SERVICE = new WorkerService({
        routes:[
            (self as any).SERVICE,
            //GPUService,
            workerCanvasRoutes,
            ECSService,
            unsafeRoutes //allows dynamic route loading
        ],
        includeClassName:false
    });

}

export default self as any;

<p>This worker implements several useful services including a dedicated gpu.js instance, allowing for multithreaded gpu kernel calls for zero downtime on the main thread.</p>
<p>Now you can post commands and subscribe to results easily, or chain threads via message ports easily (see worker.service.md).</p>
<p>Note the unsafeRoutes allow writing functions, properties, and classes to the thread from another thread. Use with caution!</p>
