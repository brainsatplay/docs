### Non-invasive biosensing hardware:

#### [PPG](./PPG.html)

Photoplethysmography detects blood oxygen, pulse, breathing, blood pressure, and more. 

#### [ECG](./ECG.html)

Electrocardiography detects heart rhythm, breathing, heart artifacts, and more. Heart Rate Variability is a popular biofeedback marker with these devices.

#### [EMG](./EMG.html)

Electromyography detects muscle activation and can be used for motor or behavioral analysis. 

#### [EEG](./EEG.html)

Electroencephalography detects brain activity using scalp surface electrodes. This includes signals with <100Hz frequencies that are created by ensembles of neural activation across the brain.

#### [FNIRS](./FNIRS.html)

Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy uses infrared and red light to penetrate and detect blood-oxygen and metabolic activation in the brain. This includes imaging techniques using arrays of FNIRS sensors for a type of tomography to build shallow FMRI-equivalent images of the brain - but much faster and cheaper! You can detect metabolic activation in the brain which marks overall regional neural activity which can be used to develop BCI interfaces or biofeedback protocols, and with more reproducibile results. 

#### [EDA/GSR](./EDA.html)

Electrodermal Activity and Galvanic Skin Response are interesting physiological markers, commonly used 

#### [Ultrasound](https://kelu124.github.io/openultrasoundprojects/)

Ultrasound uses arrays of transducers to pick up high frequency sound vibrations that are reflected off the body. These can be used to reconstruct 3D images of the body's structures. There is more combining light for photoacoustic imaging, which allows for looking at particular tissues or phenomenon. 

#### [EIT](https://github.com/OpenEIT)

Electrical Impedance Tomography uses arrays of electrodes and controlled electrical pulses to pass current through an object or body, allowing for imaging. 

#### [Microscopy](./Microscopy.html)

DIY microscopes!

#### [Imaging](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/)

Imaging technologies include MRI and Ionized radiation techniques, these are not meant for playing with.
