# Your First Blog
This tutorial will guide you through the development of a personal blog using the Brains@Play Framework.

> Our hope is that the Brains@Play Framework is used to support a blog framework that can grow into a better Wordpress / Wix where users can play with the behavior of the application on the fly—rather than be forever constrained by the rules of the underlying system. Check on the progress of [ESCode](https://github.com/brainsatplay/escode/blob/main/libraries/escode/README.md) to see if blogging features have been added.
