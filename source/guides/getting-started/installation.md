# Installation
To get started, import `brainsatplay` into your project:

#### Browser
##### Script Tag
``` html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brainsatplay@latest">
```

#### ES6
``` js
import * as brainsatplay from 'brainsatplay'
```

#### Node.js
``` js
const brainsatplay = require('brainsatplay')
```

After you've installed the Brains@Play Framework, you're going to need to [familiarize yourself with a few conventions](./conventions.md) before you can develop your first application!
